<h1>Monte Carlo PI Calculator</h1>
<p>There is a square ([0,0], [0,1], [1,1], [1,0]) with a circle centered at origin with a radius of one. The program randomly generates a point inside the square, if the point is inside the circle a counter is incremented, else if it is outside the circle another counter is incremented. Since a quarter of a Area of a circle with radius of 1 is PI/4, then (points in circle)/total points multiplyied by 4 equals to PI.  </p>
